**EU-PDF-Benchmark** is a small scale benchmark for PDF transcriptions in markdown based on European PDF documents in open data. While limited in size, the benchmark aims to be closer to actual documents used in European RAG applications. 

All pages were obtained through European administrative documents from government and administration websites. Pages have been purposefully chosen to feature challenging yet realistic layout design and compositions, with images, graphs, charts, forms, bibliographies, table of contents, flyer horizontal format, magazines, official government announcements, ads, instructions etc.).
