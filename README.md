# EU-PDF-Benchmark

**EU-PDF-Benchmark** is a small scale benchmark for PDF transcriptions in markdown based on European PDF documents in open data. While limited in size, the benchmark aims to be closer to actual documents used in European RAG applications.

While the evaluation of document analysis models used to rely on annotated bounding boxes, this approach has been reconsidered with the recent rise of _Vision language models_. With the exceptions of CC-OCR, all the recent benchmarks (READoc, OmniDocBench, MDEval, IDP Leaderboard) reimplement some form of editing distance over markdown or latex transcriptions. Most of the evaluated documents come from scientific corpus, especially arXiv and are primarily in English or Chinese.

All pages were obtained through European administrative documents from government and administration websites. Pages have been purposefully chosen to feature challenging yet realistic layout design and compositions, with images, graphs, charts, forms, bibliographies, table of contents, flyer horizontal format, magazines, official government announcements, ads, instructions etc.).
